    "description": "In my third year of school, I faced an exhilarating challenge: the frontend exam. Tasked with creating a collection web app in React, I drew inspiration from the Headspace website for its design, while centering the collection around roller coasters. The project, aptly named Collezione also involved developing a Laravel backend API to facilitate seamless interaction with the collection, adding features like user authentication and data validation. Throughout the process, I encountered and overcame various challenges, honing my skills in both frontend and backend development. The result was Collezione - a captivating web application that combined sleek design with thrilling content, showcasing my proficiency as a developer.",
